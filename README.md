CYFastImage
===========

A iOS library for displaying web images by Swift. It's inspired by SDWebImage and Volley. 

I tried some features in Swift:
		
* fulfilling namespace feature in Swift by using nest types and extensions
* accomplishing singleton by type properties
* using custom NSOperation to do simple network quque
* using lovely and great closures to remove delegates ! It's much more elegate than block. 

There are also many things need to be done, such as runloop in separate thread for NSURLConnection, using NSURLSession instead of NSURLConnection.

Example
========
Just like this:

	imageView.setImageURL("http://g.hiphotos.baidu.com/image/pic/item/dc54564e9258d1097dec49e3d358ccbf6c814d50.jpg", 
	placeHolderImage: UIImage(named: "default_placeholder.png"))
